Step 1: **Generate Packets**
   - Use Python code to generate network packets.
   - Run: `packet.py`

Step 2: **Remove GTP Layer**
   - If the GTP layer is present in packets, use the TraceWrangler tool to remove it. If not, you can skip this step.

Step 3: **Convert packets in pcapng to pcap format**
   - Use the Tshark tool to convert the file from pcapng to pcap.
   - command: `tshark -F pcap -r captured_packets.pcapng -w captured_packets.pcap`

Step 4: **Convert pcap file to Network Flows then in CSV Format**
   - Use the Argus tool to convert the file from pcap to network flows and then to CSV format.
   - command: `argus -r captured_packets.pcap -w captured_packets.argus`
   - ra -r  captured_packets.argus -u -s  proto > proto.csv 
   - ra -r  captured_packets.argus -u -s  sttl > sttl.csv
   - ra -r  captured_packets.argus -u -s  offset > offset.csv
   - ra -r  captured_packets.argus -u -s  state > state.csv
   - ra -r  captured_packets.argus -u -s  seq > seq.csv
   - ra -r  captured_packets.argus -u -s  smeansz > smeansz.csv
   - ra -r  captured_packets.argus -u -s  ackdat > ackdat.csv
   - ra -r  captured_packets.argus -u -s  tcprtt > tcprtt.csv

Step 5: **Merge the CSV Files**
   - Use Python code to merge the generated CSV file.
   - Run: `csv_merge.py`

Step 6: **Encode the CSV file and  Features process**
   - Use Python code to encode the features from the merge CSV file.
   - Run: `process_final.py`

Step 7: **Train the Encoded CSV File on Machine Learning Model**
   - Use the encoded CSV file to train a machine-learning model.
   - We use the Random forest model, which is already trained on an encoded CSV file and saved with the name "Random_forest.sav"
   - Run: `Random_forest.py` 
  
Step 8: **Create a script and write all these steps sequentially**

   - In the script, we write all the steps from packets generated by Python code(1st step) to merged CSV file trained on ML(step 7).
   - Now we analysis whether the attack is "Malicious" or "Benign"?
   - Run: `script.sh`
