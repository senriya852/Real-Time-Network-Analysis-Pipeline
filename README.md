Step 1: **Generate Packets**
   - Use Python code to generate network packets.
   - Run file packet.py

Step 2: **Remove GTP Layer**
   - If the GTP layer is present in packets, use the TraceWrangler tool to remove it. If not, you can skip this step.

Step 3: **Convert packets in pcapng to pcap format**
   - Use the Tshark tool to convert the file from `pcapng` to `pcap`.

Step 4: **Convert pcap file to Network Flows then in CSV Format**
   - Use the Argus tool to convert the file from `pcap` to network flows and then to CSV format.

Step 5: **Encode CSV File**
   - Use Python code to encode the CSV file.

Step 6: **Extract Required Features**
   - Use Python code to extract the necessary features from the encoded CSV file.

Step 7: **Train the Encoded CSV File on Machine Learning Model**
   - Use the encoded CSV file to train a machine-learning model.
   - We use Random forest here that is "Random_forest.sav"
  
Step 8: **Create a script and write all these steps sequentially**

   -In the script, we write all the steps from packets generated by Python code(1st step) to merged CSV file trained on ML(step 7).
   -Now we analysis whether the attack is "Malicious" or "Benign"
